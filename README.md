## Overview
This repository contains all the resources and code for my project exploring the mortality rates associated with various heart diseases, utilizing data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to analyze mortality rates related to different heart diseases using a dataset sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The analysis covers:
- Yearly mortality statistics from 1999 to 2019
- Geographical variations in heart disease mortality
- Trends and preventive measures through data visualization

I employed data cleaning and processing techniques using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, followed by insightful visualizations created in Power BI to represent the findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For additional data plotting and visualization

## Results
- The analysis revealed significant trends in heart disease mortality, with specific demographics showing higher rates.
- Visualizations in Power BI effectively illustrated the data, showcasing trends over time and highlighting areas for potential intervention.
- The project emphasized the importance of preventive measures in addressing the mortality rates associated with heart diseases.

## Conclusion
This project offered valuable insights into the patterns and trends of heart disease mortality, enhancing my understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques. It demonstrates the critical role of data-driven insights in addressing public health challenges.
